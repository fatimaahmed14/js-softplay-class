# Soft Play

## Setup

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your forked repository to your machine
3. Change directory into the project.
4. Install the project dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

## Requirements

You need to write a program that **maintains a count** of both the number of children and adults inside a soft player center. Inside the `src/soft-play.js` file, you should add a class named `Softplay` that accepts two parameters in its constructor: `numAdults` and `numChildren`. These represent the initial state stored in the class.

The class should have the following methods:

### enter(numAdults, numChildren)

This method is used to register adults and children entering the soft play center. The method should check for the following conditions:

- Every child entering the soft play center is accompanied by at least 1 adult.

If any of these checks fail, the method should return `false`. Otherwise, the method should return `true` and `numAdults` and `numChildren` should be added to the current totals.

### leave(numAdults, numChildren)

This method is used to register adults and children leaving the soft play center. The method should check for the following conditions:

- A child is not attempting to leave without an adult
- The number of adults and children left inside the center will not cause there to be more children than adults (there must be at least 1 adult for 1 child inside the center at all times)
- Every child leaving the soft play center is accompanied by at least 1 adult.
- The number of adults and children attempting to leave is not greater than the number currently inside the center

If any of these checks fail, method should return `false`. Otherwise, the method should return `true` and `numAdults` and `numChildren` should be deducted from the current totals.

### occupancy()

This method should return an object with two keys - `adults` should contain the number of adults currently inside the soft play center and `children` the number of children. For example:

```javascript
{
  adults: 4,
  children: 3
}
```

## Tips

Remember that classes can have fields (also called attributes or properties) to store values.

```javascript
class Counter {
  constructor(initialCount) {
    this.count = initialCount
  }

  incrementCounter() {
    this.count++
  }

  decrementCounter() {
    this.count--
  }
}
```

## Example

The REPL extract below illustrates the expected behavior of the functions.

```javascript
const sp = new Softplay(0, 0)
//counts start at 0
> sp.occupancy()
{ adults: 0, children: 0 }

//2 adults and 1 child enter
> sp.enter(2, 1)
true

//counts are updated
> sp.occupancy()
{ adults: 2, children: 1 }

//1 adult leaves
> sp.leave(1, 0)
true

//Only 1 adult and 1 child remain
> sp.occupancy()
{ adults: 1, children: 1 }

//a child attempts to enter on their own, enter returns false
> sp.enter(0,1)
false

//counts stay the same
> sp.occupancy()
{ adults: 1, children: 1 }

//the last adult attempts to leave so false is returned (as child would be on their own in soft play)
> sp.leave(1,0)
false

//counts stay the same
> sp.occupancy()
{ adults: 1, children: 1 }

//the last child and adult leave together
> sp.leave(1,1)
true

//both counts are now 0
> sp.occupancy()
{ adults: 0, children: 0 }
```

## Testing

A test has already been created for your function inside
`spec/soft-play.spec.js`. You should not need to modify this file. You can run the tests using npx:

```sh
npx jasmine spec/soft-play.spec.js
```

You can focus on passing one test at a time by implementing your methods step by step. When all the tests pass, you know your functions are complete. You can look at the test cases in the `spec/soft-play.spec.js` file, but you should not change any of the code.

## Extension

Once you have finished the core methods, you can extend the exercise to include an additional method:

### total()

This method should return an object with the same structure as `occupancy`, but the values should be the all-time totals showing how many adults and children have entered the soft play center. For this extension exercise add your own test cases in to `spec/soft-play.spec.js`

### Scalability

Once you have completed the exercise, take some time to consider following points and try to implement a solution for them:

- The class you have created only considers a single soft play center - what if we wanted to keep track of multiple soft play centers at the same time?

- If we do keep track of multiple soft play centers, imagine we also want to have different rules for different centers. For example, perhaps in some centers a child must be accompanied by at least 2 adults.
